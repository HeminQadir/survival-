1. Created N_VAE_UNET.py --> Added time deocder layers and forward method. 
2. losses.py  --> Added LogLikelihoodLossWithCensoring
3. process.py --> Added SURV_loss = LogLikelihoodLossWithCensoring(dist_type='weibull')
4. utils.py  -> modified def train --> logit_map, mu, logvar, weibull_params = model(x)
            kl_loss = -0.5 * torch.mean(1 + logvar - mu.pow(2) - logvar.exp())
            surv_loss = SURV_loss(weibull_params, s_time, risk) 
            loss = mse_loss + ssim_loss + kl_loss + surv_loss
   #TODO:  didnot do in the validation loop (sliding_window_inference)

5. Created N_eval.py -->  copy pasted the ci_ibs code
    #TODO need to install pycox, statsmodels
    #TODO need to do it for ALL TRAIN DATA per epoch, NOT for every batch or trainloader.
    #TODO need to compute in the training loop
